# Fox recognition
The primary objective of this project is to develop a program capable of recognizing the presence of foxes in photographic images. This entails the creation of a machine-learning model that can accurately differentiate images containing foxes from those that do not, thereby providing a binary output indicative of a fox's presence. To achieve this, the project will employ the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm, a choice motivated by its robustness in object detection and its foundational reliance on linear algebra principles. This research aims to not only contribute to wildlife management efforts but also enhance our understanding and application of the SVD algorithm in the context of animal detection.
